# CSUS-Comp-Sci
This is a documentation of Courses taken at California State University of Sacramento. Not every single bit of assignments are listed but I was able to find and recover all that I could and assemble it here for the world to see.

## PLEASE TAKE NOTE:
While all of these assignments are my work, I cannot guarentee they are all 100% correct. I have put in many hours of work to pass all the courses listed and do not condone any attempt to pass off the code as your own. Just put in a little effort and I'm sure you'll figure it out but if you NEED it then my code may serve as a REFERENCE but that's it. Feel free to reach out to me, you can contact me through any link on my profile. Professors and TA's are aware of my repository and they also have the fancy technology in order to sniff out any cheaters out there.
