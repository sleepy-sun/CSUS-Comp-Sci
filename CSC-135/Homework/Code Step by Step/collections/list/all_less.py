# Write a function named all_less that accepts two lists of integers and 
# returns True if each element in the first list is less than the element 
# at the same index in the second list. Your function should return false 
# if the lists are not the same length. For example, if the two lists 
# passed are [45, 20, 300] and [50, 41, 600], your function should return 
# True. If the lists are not the same length, you should always return False.
