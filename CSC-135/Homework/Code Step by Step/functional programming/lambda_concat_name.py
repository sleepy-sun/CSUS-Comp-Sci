# Define a lambda expression named f that accepts two string parameters 
# representing a first and last name and concatenates them together to 
# return a string in "Last, First" format. For example, if passed "Cynthia" 
# and "Lee", it would return "Lee, Cynthia". Do not write an entire function; 
# just write a statement of the form:

# f = lambda parameters: expression

f = lambda x,y: y + ", " + x
